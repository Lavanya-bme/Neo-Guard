Newborns, especially preterm or critically ill infants, require constant and accurate monitoring. Traditional systems are often bulky, invasive, and limited to hospital settings, which can delay early detection of health issues and increase the risk of complications.The Smart Neonatal Monitoring System (SNMS) is an advanced solution designed to monitor the health of newborns in real-time,particularly in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs). 
The system uses wearable sensors and a cloud-based platform to provide continuous,non-invasive, and reliable monitoring of vital signs, ensuring immediate intervention when abnormalities are detected.
This System offers round-the-clock monitoring of newborns, ensuring early identification of critical health issues and minimizing the risk of human error. It enhances NICU efficiency, allows remote parental monitoring, and integrates data into EHR for better decision-making and personalized care.
